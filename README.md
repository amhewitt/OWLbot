OWLbot
=======

OWLbot is a bot for reporting scores and schedules from the Overwatch League API.  It is written using Node.js and Discordie but mainly I just used BroBot as a template.

###Features
* Sends a notification message when the next OWL match is scheduled to start

###Commands
* `schedule`: displays the next 3 matches on the schedule
* `standings <stage>`: displays the current OWL standings, or optionally, the standings from one specific stage

TODO: add `schedule <team>` and `standings <team>` to display team-specific playing times and results.
